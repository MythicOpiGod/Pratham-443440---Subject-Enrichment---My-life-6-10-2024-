<h1><hr><center>My Life at 12-13</center></h1><p><hr>When I was 12, I really got into computers and AI becuse I knew that AI was gonna be the future. Since then, I started dreaming to be the FACE OF THE FUTURE. Yes, the face of the future, I wanted to be an inventor who created the greatest inventions which would upgrade mobility and use it for sustainability. I was also a big football fan and, thus, I decided to join a Football Academy named ROYAL SPARTANS. Over there, I learned many things, not only I became good in football, but also I learnt a few life skills such as importance of teamwork and leadership. Taking Cristiano Ronaldo as my idol, who was known for his hard working the most, I started working hard not only towards football but also academics and I ended with good marks in most of the subjects. While I was working hard, I also gave time to my family and friends to make our relationships better. Through my friends, I was able to make more friends. These friends always used to help and support me. I was very lucky to have such good friends. Once, I also applied for Student Council for Vice Captain post for Sapphire house because I was also a patriot towards Sapphire and I wanted to do good for my house and also for my school. I tried my best to lead Sapphire and do my duties as a Student Council member, and all I could say was that I was pretty much successful in the post.<p>
